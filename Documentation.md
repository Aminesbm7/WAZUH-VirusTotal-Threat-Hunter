# Starting Point

Once we have the wazuh installed and configured, with our wazuh-agent on the client, and we are able to see it on the dashboard
we can start with this project.

# VirusTotal Integration

The first thing we need to do is to add a virustotal integration to our wazuh, in the wazuh machine cli, we add this integration,
with your virustotal api key.
